Policy based networking for cloud native applications.

Canal brings together Calico network policy with flannel networking.

The current implementation of this for Kubernetes is in the [coreos/coreos-kubernetes](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-kubernetes) repository which provides an easy way to bring up a Kubernetes cluster which uses flannel for networking and Calico for policy.
