# Policy based networking for cloud native applications #

Canal is a community-driven initiative that integrates the [Calico](https://projectcalico.org/) and  [flannel](https://coreos.com/flannel/docs/latest/) networking projects. Applying Calico’s industry-leading network policy enforcement capabilities to flannel’s broad range of connectivity options, Canal represents the best-of-breed policy-based networking solution for cloud native applications.

Phase 0 of Canal is available today in the [coreos/coreos-kubernetes](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-kubernetes) repository and provides an easy way to bring up a Kubernetes cluster that uses flannel for networking and Calico for policy.

Watch this space for news of further integration and new features coming soon!
